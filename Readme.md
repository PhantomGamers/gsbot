### Description

- Mongodb
- discord.py

## Installation


### Python Virtual Environment

This project is best ran in a virtual environment. You can use [pyvenv][3],
which comes with python 3 and greater. The virtual enviroment lets you run
different versions of python and packages from other projects.

#### Installation (Unix)

First install python3+ on your machine which should come with [pip][4]. If
not, download from link provided.

1. `python3 -m venv env` - Create a virtual environment in the env folder
2. `source env/bin/activate` - Load the environment
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt` - Install dependencies
4. `deactivate` - Unloads the environment


#### Installation (Windows)
Note - Most documentation is for unix systems. Differences between windows and unix are: `env\Scripts\` instead of `env/bin/` and libraries go in `env\Lib\` rather than `env/lib/`)

First install python3+ on your machine and then download and install [pip][4].
Then from the root of the project run:

1. `pip install virtualenv` - Install virtualenv if not already done soCreate a virtual environment in the venv folder
2. `virtualenv venv` - This creates will create a series of directories and scripts
3. `venv/Scripts/activate` - Load the enviroment (There should be a (venv) before the current directory path name
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt` - Install dependencies
5. `deactivate` - Unloads the environment

## Running

Once your dependencies are installed, there are a couple of steps you need to do before running.

1. create a`config.ini` file inside of the main directory
2. Setup config file like the example below:

```
[auth]  
token = ... #This is where you put your bot token that you get from discord
token2 = ...
token3 = ...

[db]
name = gsbot
port = 27017
collection = gsdata
```

3. Have an instance of mongodb running. The bot, as it stands, is configured to connect to 
a localhost instance of mongo on port 27017. If you would like different configurations,
make sure you change the config file accordingly.
